/* This is a library of functions that implements the truncated
 * polynomial expansion method (TPEM) described in the paper.
 * The software library is designed to be called by other programs
 * but a sample working program (tpem_test.c) is included.
 */
 
SAMPLE PROGRAM
Compilation of the sample program (tpem_test.c):
Requirements: A C compiler. 
Optionally the LAPACK library, "make" utility and the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). 

On Linux: Simply issue:
make

On other platforms: The "Makefile" provided for linux can be modified for use on other
platforms. An example is provided for Mac OS X in the file "Makefile.osx", so
in this case the command to compile the sample program is: 
make -f Makefile.osx

	        
Run the program with:
./tpem_test
The program does not take any input and applies the TPEM to a random matrix. The output and
further explanation is provided in the paper and in the file sample.output

GENERAL USE
To compile other programs that use the TPEM software library:
Compile the test program to create the library (libtpem.a). Include the header:
"tpem.h"
in your source code that calls TPEM library functions. Compile your source code as you normally would
 but adding the parameters 
-L. -ltpem
to the linker(see sample Makefile).


ADDITIONAL NOTES:
Using LAPACK: For the test program, LAPACK can be used to perform the matrix diagonalization. To enable this the
	-DNO_LAPACK preprocessor define has to be removed and the LAPACK library added to the Makefile.
Using the GSL: An alternative way of calculating TPEM coefficients can be done with the GSL library instead of the
		default function. The use of the GSL is optional and usually not needed. 
		To use the GSL remove the option -DNO_GSL from the Makefile and add -lgsl -lgslcblas. Make sure the
		GSL library files can be found by the linker. Note: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
		can be found at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
